# Entrainment as a Measure of Dilution

In this study, precise mathematical expressions for turbulent mass exchange processes at the scale of individual clouds during moist convection are presented. A high-resolution large-eddy simulation is used to model weakly-precipitating tropical marine boundary-layer cumulus clouds during BOMEX. Individual cloud entrainment and detrainment rates are calculated directly using the tetrahedral interpolation scheme. The explicitly calculated entrainment and detrainment rates are used to examine the proportional changes in the properties of the individual clouds, and it is shown that the proposed set of equations can accurately determine the changes in individual cloud properties in terms of entrainment and detrainment rates. The theoretical definition of the mass exchange process is re-evaluated based on the mass-flux framework. The rate of dilution, as opposed to that of entrainment, is defined in terms of the changes in cloud properties whose behaviour is driven not only by entrainment and detrainment processes, but also by the characteristics of the entrained air with respect to those of the cloud. Dilution of individual clouds is not well correlated to entrainment and detrainment due to the existence of moist shell that modulates turbulent mixing processes between the cloud and the environment, which is also the cause of the discrepancy between traditional bulk-plume approximations and directly calculated rates of entrainment and detrainment.
